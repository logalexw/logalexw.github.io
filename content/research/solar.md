Predictive models for solar weather and activity rely on large amounts of data from extensive timescales, from one year to multiple 11-year-long solar cycles. I worked with Slava Sadykov at Georgia State University to support the development of more accurate prediction models for solar activity. **Using magnetograms from the operational overlap between the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI), I established machine learning models to enable the creation of a homogenous magnetic dataset spanning from 1994-present.** These regression models resolved differences in instrument resolution, operational limitations, and observatory location. I also researched algorithm refinement and effectiveness on active regions and the quiet Sun.
