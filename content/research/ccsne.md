Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe; SNe IIp) serve as the endpoints of the long lives of massive stars and the formative moments of young compact objects, such as black holes and neutron stars. In the data driven world of multimessenger astronomy, exploring how observations connect to theory-driven simulations is key to our understanding. **I am currently developing a comprehensive statistical analysis of lightcurve models to investigate supernovae simulation accuracy** with Carla Fr√∂hlich at North Carolina State University and Brandon Barker at Los Alamos National Lab. 

Using the stellar evolution models presented in [Sukhbold et al. 2016](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/821/1/38), I have modeled early timescale CCSNe hydrodynamics using [PUSH](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aae7c9), calculated detailed nucleosynthesis for all exploding models using a 2000+ isotope nuclear reaction network, and generated post-collapse bolometric lightcurves using the SuperNova Explosion Code (SNEC). I am now exploring the connection between our simulations and observed lightcurves using the methodologies first used in [Barker et al. 2022](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac77f3); [2023](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acb052).

**Stay tuned for two upcoming publications detailing this work!**
