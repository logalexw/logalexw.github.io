ESTER (Evolution STEllaire en Rotation; Rieutord et al. 2016) is the first open-source, multi-dimensional stellar structure code. I am working with Jane Pratt and Maxime Stuck as a GEM Fellow at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to update the 'microphysics' of ESTER, with a focus on rapidly rotating stars. **I recently implemented new, high-resolution OPLIB opacity tables (Farag et al. 2024) into the existing physics module**, expanding the number of opacity mixtures available in ESTER, improving interpolation methods, and enabling the future use of user-provided opacity tables.
