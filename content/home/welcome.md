## about me.

I'm an **incoming Ph.D. student in Astronomy & Astrophysics** and **NSF Graduate Research Fellow** at the University of Arizona.

 Broadly, **I'm interested in the life, death, and remnants of massive stars**, and enjoy using computational methods to explore the border between theory and observation. I currently research the evolution and dynamics of stellar interiors with Jane Pratt as a GEM Fellow through Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. I also research the hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, and observables of core-collapse supernovae with Carla Fr√∂hlich at my undergraduate alma mater, North Carolina State University.

When I'm not writing code, you can find me working on a variety of science communication, mentorship, and outreach projects. I currently serve on the Student Council for the [National Society of Black Physicists](https://nsbp.org).

You can read more about my [research](/research); if you want more info on my background, please see my [CV](/images/cv.pdf). You can also find useful [resources](/resources) for undergraduates and non-traditional students!
