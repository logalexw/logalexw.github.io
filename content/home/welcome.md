## about me.

I'm a final-year Physics undergraduate at North Carolina State University and an **incoming Ph.D. student in Astronomy & Astrophysics** at the University of Arizona, starting in Fall 2025.

I currently research the hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, and observables of core-collapse supernovae with Dr. Carla Fr√∂hlich. Broadly, **I'm interested in the life, death, and remnants of massive stars**, and enjoy using computational methods to explore the border between theory and observation. 

When I'm not writing code, you can find me working on a variety of science communication, mentorship, and outreach projects. I currently serve as the Science Advisor for the [NASA L'SPACE Mission Concept Academy](https://www.lspace.asu.edu/mission-concept-academy) as a NASA LEAP Intern. 

You can read more about my [research](/research); if you want more info on my background, please see my [CV](/images/cv.pdf). You can also find useful [resources](/resources) for undergraduates and non-traditional students!
