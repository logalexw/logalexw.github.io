## about me.

I'm a **first-year Ph.D. student in Astronomy & Astrophysics** and **NSF Graduate Research Fellow** at the University of Arizona, where I work with Carl Fields to model the **life, evolution, and death of massive stars** using a variety of astrophysics codes, including [MESA](https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/#) and [PHOEBUS](https://github.com/lanl/phoebus). 

In addition, I currently research the [structure of stellar interiors](/research/ester.md) with Jane Pratt as a GEM Fellow at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and am working on extending the physics of the 2D open-source code ESTER. I also research the [hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, and observables of core-collapse supernovae in 1D](/research/ccsne.md) with Carla Fr√∂hlich at my undergraduate alma mater, North Carolina State University. Generally, I enjoy using computational methods to explore the border between theory, experiment, and observation! 

When I'm not writing code, you can find me working on a variety of science communication, mentorship, and outreach projects. I currently serve on the Student Council for the [National Society of Black Physicists](https://nsbp.org) and am the **Student Editorial Lead of Waves & Packets**, NSBP's newsletter.

If you want more info on my background, please see my [CV](/images/cv.pdf). You can also find useful [resources](/resources) for undergraduates and non-traditional students!
