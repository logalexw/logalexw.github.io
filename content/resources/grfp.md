I applied (successfully!) to the NSF GRFP during the 2024 application cycle. If you're intimidated or overwhelmed by the propsect of proposing like I was, here's some resources and advice that may help. 

I found that referring to previous application materials (like those on [Brandon Barker's website](https://astrobarker.github.io); see the resources section) was very helpful when getting started, so feel free to do the same with mine!

> #### some general advice.
> 1. **Read the solicitation (and then read it again).** Little things like formatting or timezones/deadlines can trip you up and disqualify your application before it’s even submitted and reviewed.
> 2. **Use the provided MS Word templates.** They already have the correct formatting built in and can save you from mistakes or conversion errors that can happen if you use Google Docs, etc.
> 3. **Have others read your applications.** I asked my current research advisor at the time, another professor in my field, and a professor who’s research wasn’t related at all (he had the most useful feedback!). Use the people in your field to make sure your science is good; find someone totally outside of your field to make sure you’re communicating well and getting the big picture across.
> 4. **Don't panic if you're not starting early.** I almost didn't apply because I nearly talked myself out of it, and then decided last minute to go through with the proposal for the experience. Make a plan, gather your thoughts, and talk to your support system, whether that's your advisor/PI, a favorite professor, or your family and peers. You've got this!
> 5. **Think of this as a learning process!** Because I submitted fellowship proposals before graduate applications opened, I was able to write my later application materials (like statements of purpose and personal statements) fairly quickly (during finals season!) because I’d essentially drafted them through my fellowship applications.

**DISCLAIMER.** All advice above is based on my own personal experiences. Please make sure you refer to [NSF.gov](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program) yourself to make sure you're working with the most up-to-date information, solicitation, and guidelines.
