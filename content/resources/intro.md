Hello there! If you're on this page, hopefully you're looking for resources to help you apply for internships, REUs (research experiences for undergraduates), or graduate programs. If so, you're in the right place.

As a non-traditional, first-gen Ph.D. student, I struggled to find information, resources, and tools when applying to a variety of academic experiences and opportunities (from REUs to grad schools!). My hope is that by sharing my own tools and resources I developed through trial and error, I can make your own journey just a little bit smoother.

If there's a resource that you've found helpful and want to see added to this page, please let me know! I plan to keep this updated periodically as I learn more and progress in my own career, so stay tuned.
