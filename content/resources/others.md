I'm not the only person who's compiled advice, tools and resources, so here's the other places I'd recommend checking out! 

My collaborator **Brandon Barker** (LANL, by way of MSU) has most of his past application materials for both graduate and undergraduate fellowships and experiences compiled on [**his personal website**](), along with a list of useful undergraduate research opportunities. I used this page a *lot* when developing my own applications for grad school.

Fellow NC State Physics alum **Josh Ott** (now at MIT!) has a [**library on his website**](https://joshott.net/physics/library/) with a variety of resources, including successful application materials, slides, and more!
