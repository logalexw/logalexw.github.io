One of the hardest parts of application season (aside from writing the actual application materials) is keeping yourself and your recommenders organized! Below I've linked my own templates that I used for various application cycles; make a copy of these to your own Google Drive and feel free to make whatever modifications or changes suit your style!

- [Application Tracker (complex)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KU_31s21nKIAj-0yuHBJBTAiIHwBGlhFNjBySU3Pxq0/edit?usp=share_link) >> I used this for my own internal purposes to track information and statuses of Ph.D. applications.
- [Application Tracker (simple)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1968NuydKmU1WZXhv7Vw1gnEj9ib9ECtcdi_hTRifwcE/edit?usp=sharing) >> I used this for my own internal purposes to track information and statuses of REU/internship applications.
- [Recommendation Request Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JlrfkySM1JpoVH-_Yw46ib9uoQfoN3thFPkg53_A8I0/edit?usp=share_link) >> I sent copies of this to each of my recommendation writers so that we could track submissions together.

Each of the templates has helpful comments to indicate how certain fields/formatting works. Best of luck in your applications!
