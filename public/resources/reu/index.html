        <p>I used <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/reu/search"><strong>this directory from NSF</strong></a> to make my initial list of REUs I wanted to apply to. Keep in mind that many of these usually link to the university websites and don&rsquo;t always show deadline info, etc. so you&rsquo;ll have to dig a little deeper to get more details. Some programs have a unified application now, so keep an eye out for that too!</p>

<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: if there are projects or professors who you&rsquo;re interested in working with that you notice while deciding to apply, consider mentioning that (or specific aspects of the program you like) in your application! It shows that you&rsquo;ve done your research and aren&rsquo;t just randomly applying.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding personal statements, you can find two of my past (successful) personal statements linked below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ss0KnoFrItaDwTtHyf6QtIcEbrKjvug88OIp5zcjN4U/edit?usp=sharing">Sample REU Personal Statements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be scared to brag or show off unique experiences/skills you have in your personal statement. This is the place to talk about what makes you stand out and what you want to gain from the program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Helpful tip:</strong> absolutely have someone (or several people) read your personal statement! It&rsquo;s helpful for catching any mistakes and making sure you&rsquo;re communicating the message you want to get across clearly.</p></blockquote>
<p>When trying to keep track of applications, I was a big fan of putting together a spreadsheet that had all the info I (and my recommenders) might need. Feel free to make a copy of the <a href="/resources/templates/">templates</a> I created; you can find a simple version or the more complex/dynamic version I used for my grad school applications. I recommend sending your letter writers a brief spreadsheet or table of deadlines and programs as well to make their lives just a bit easier.</p>
<p>Finally, I recommend (with a word of caution) the Reddit, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/REU/">r/REU</a>. While there are some individuals on there who are just around to brag, I found this very helpful when I was just starting out to search for programs of interest, see other students&rsquo; personal statements, and learn more about the world of REUs. That being said, it also jumpstarted my impostor syndrome as well, especially as a first time applicant, so take care of your mental health and don&rsquo;t get sucked into the negativity or competitiveness.</p>
