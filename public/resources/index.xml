      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! If you&amp;rsquo;re on this page, hopefully you&amp;rsquo;re looking for resources to help you apply for internships, REUs (research experiences for undergraduates), or graduate programs. If so, you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a non-traditional, first-gen Ph.D. student, I struggled to find information, resources, and tools when applying to a variety of academic experiences and opportunities (from REUs to grad schools!). My hope is that by sharing my own tools and resources I developed through trial and error, I can make your own journey just a little bit smoother.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts of application season (aside from writing the actual application materials) is keeping yourself and your recommenders organized! Below I&amp;rsquo;ve linked my own templates that I used for various application cycles; make a copy of these to your own Google Drive and feel free to make whatever modifications or changes suit your style!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KU_31s21nKIAj-0yuHBJBTAiIHwBGlhFNjBySU3Pxq0/edit?usp=share_link&#34;&gt;Application Tracker (complex)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;raquo; I used this for my own internal purposes to track information and statuses of Ph.D. applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1968NuydKmU1WZXhv7Vw1gnEj9ib9ECtcdi_hTRifwcE/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;Application Tracker (simple)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;raquo; I used this for my own internal purposes to track information and statuses of REU/internship applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JlrfkySM1JpoVH-_Yw46ib9uoQfoN3thFPkg53_A8I0/edit?usp=share_link&#34;&gt;Recommendation Request Tracker&lt;/a&gt; &amp;raquo; I sent copies of this to each of my recommendation writers so that we could track submissions together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the templates has helpful comments to indicate how certain fields/formatting works. Best of luck in your applications!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>nsf graduate research fellowship program (grfp).</title>
      <link>https://logalexw.github.io/resources/grfp/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://logalexw.github.io/resources/grfp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I applied (successfully!) to the NSF GRFP during the 2024 application cycle. If you&amp;rsquo;re intimidated or overwhelmed by the propsect of proposing like I was, here&amp;rsquo;s some resources and advice that may help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that referring to previous application materials (like those on &lt;a href=&#34;https://astrobarker.github.io&#34;&gt;Brandon Barker&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;; see the resources section) was very helpful when getting started, so feel free to do the same with mine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://logalexw.github.io/images/GRFP_ResearchStatement_LWhite.pdf&#34;&gt;Research Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://logalexw.github.io/images/GRFP_PersonalStatement_LWhite.pdf&#34;&gt;Personal Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;some-general-advice&#34;&gt;some general advice.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the solicitation (and then read it again).&lt;/strong&gt; Little things like formatting or timezones/deadlines can trip you up and disqualify your application before it’s even submitted and reviewed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the provided MS Word templates.&lt;/strong&gt; They already have the correct formatting built in and can save you from mistakes or conversion errors that can happen if you use Google Docs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have others read your applications.&lt;/strong&gt; I asked my current research advisor at the time, another professor in my field, and a professor who’s research wasn’t related at all (he had the most useful feedback!). Use the people in your field to make sure your science is good; find someone totally outside of your field to make sure you’re communicating well and getting the big picture across.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t panic if you&amp;rsquo;re not starting early.&lt;/strong&gt; I almost didn&amp;rsquo;t apply because I nearly talked myself out of it, and then decided last minute to go through with the proposal for the experience. Make a plan, gather your thoughts, and talk to your support system, whether that&amp;rsquo;s your advisor/PI, a favorite professor, or your family and peers. You&amp;rsquo;ve got this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think of this as a learning process!&lt;/strong&gt; Because I submitted fellowship proposals before graduate applications opened, I was able to write my later application materials (like statements of purpose and personal statements) fairly quickly (during finals season!) because I’d essentially drafted them through my fellowship applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER.&lt;/strong&gt; All advice above is based on my own personal experiences. Please make sure you refer to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program&#34;&gt;NSF.gov&lt;/a&gt; yourself to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re working with the most up-to-date information, solicitation, and guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>REUs &#43; internships.</title>
      <link>https://logalexw.github.io/resources/reu/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://logalexw.github.io/resources/reu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/reu/search&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this directory from NSF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make my initial list of REUs I wanted to apply to. Keep in mind that many of these usually link to the university websites and don&amp;rsquo;t always show deadline info, etc. so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to dig a little deeper to get more details. Some programs have a unified application now, so keep an eye out for that too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helpful tip&lt;/strong&gt;: if there are projects or professors who you&amp;rsquo;re interested in working with that you notice while deciding to apply, consider mentioning that (or specific aspects of the program you like) in your application! It shows that you&amp;rsquo;ve done your research and aren&amp;rsquo;t just randomly applying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It shows that you&amp;rsquo;ve done your research and aren&amp;rsquo;t just randomly applying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding personal statements, you can find two of my past (successful) personal statements linked below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ss0KnoFrItaDwTtHyf6QtIcEbrKjvug88OIp5zcjN4U/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;Sample REU Personal Statements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be scared to brag or show off unique experiences/skills you have in your personal statement. This is the place to talk about what makes you stand out and what you want to gain from the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helpful tip:&lt;/strong&gt; absolutely have someone (or several people) read your personal statement! It&amp;rsquo;s helpful for catching any mistakes and making sure you&amp;rsquo;re communicating the message you want to get across clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying to keep track of applications, I was a big fan of putting together a spreadsheet that had all the info I (and my recommenders) might need. Feel free to make a copy of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://logalexw.github.io/resources/templates/&#34;&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; I created; you can find a simple version or the more complex/dynamic version I used for my grad school applications. I recommend sending your letter writers a brief spreadsheet or table of deadlines and programs as well to make their lives just a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I recommend (with a word of caution) the Reddit, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/REU/&#34;&gt;r/REU&lt;/a&gt;. While there are some individuals on there who are just around to brag, I found this very helpful when I was just starting out to search for programs of interest, see other students&amp;rsquo; personal statements, and learn more about the world of REUs. That being said, it also jumpstarted my impostor syndrome as well, especially as a first time applicant, so take care of your mental health and don&amp;rsquo;t get sucked into the negativity or competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not the only person who&amp;rsquo;s compiled advice, tools and resources, so here&amp;rsquo;s the other places I&amp;rsquo;d recommend checking out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My collaborator &lt;strong&gt;Brandon Barker&lt;/strong&gt; (LANL, by way of MSU) has most of his past application materials for both graduate and undergraduate fellowships and experiences compiled on &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;his personal website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, along with a list of useful undergraduate research opportunities. I used this page a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; when developing my own applications for grad school.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Fellow NC State Physics alum &lt;strong&gt;Josh Ott&lt;/strong&gt; (now at MIT!) has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshott.net/physics/library/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;library on his website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a variety of resources, including successful application materials, slides, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
