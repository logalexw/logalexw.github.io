<meta name="description" content="I applied (successfully!) to the NSF GRFP during the 2024 application cycle. If you&rsquo;re intimidated or overwhelmed by the propsect of proposing like I was, here&rsquo;s some resources and advice that may help.
I found that referring to previous application materials (like those on Brandon Barker&rsquo;s website; see the resources section) was very helpful when getting started, so feel free to do the same with mine!
Research Statement Personal Statement some general advice. Read the solicitation (and then read it again). Little things like formatting or timezones/deadlines can trip you up and disqualify your application before it’s even submitted and reviewed. Use the provided MS Word templates. They already have the correct formatting built in and can save you from mistakes or conversion errors that can happen if you use Google Docs, etc. Have others read your applications. I asked my current research advisor at the time, another professor in my field, and a professor who’s research wasn’t related at all (he had the most useful feedback!). Use the people in your field to make sure your science is good; find someone totally outside of your field to make sure you’re communicating well and getting the big picture across. Don&rsquo;t panic if you&rsquo;re not starting early. I almost didn&rsquo;t apply because I nearly talked myself out of it, and then decided last minute to go through with the proposal for the experience. Make a plan, gather your thoughts, and talk to your support system, whether that&rsquo;s your advisor/PI, a favorite professor, or your family and peers. You&rsquo;ve got this! Think of this as a learning process! Because I submitted fellowship proposals before graduate applications opened, I was able to write my later application materials (like statements of purpose and personal statements) fairly quickly (during finals season!) because I’d essentially drafted them through my fellowship applications. DISCLAIMER. All advice above is based on my own personal experiences. Please make sure you refer to NSF.gov yourself to make sure you&rsquo;re working with the most up-to-date information, solicitation, and guidelines.
