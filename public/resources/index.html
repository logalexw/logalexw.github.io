            <p>Hello there! If you&rsquo;re on this page, hopefully you&rsquo;re looking for resources to help you apply for internships, REUs (research experiences for undergraduates), or graduate programs. If so, you&rsquo;re in the right place.</p>
<p>As a non-traditional, first-gen Ph.D. student, I struggled to find information, resources, and tools when applying to a variety of academic experiences and opportunities (from REUs to grad schools!). My hope is that by sharing my own tools and resources I developed through trial and error, I can make your own journey just a little bit smoother.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a resource that you&rsquo;ve found helpful and want to see added to this page, please let me know! I plan to keep this updated periodically as I learn more and progress in my own career, so stay tuned.</p>

            <p>One of the hardest parts of application season (aside from writing the actual application materials) is keeping yourself and your recommenders organized! Below I&rsquo;ve linked my own templates that I used for various application cycles; make a copy of these to your own Google Drive and feel free to make whatever modifications or changes suit your style!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KU_31s21nKIAj-0yuHBJBTAiIHwBGlhFNjBySU3Pxq0/edit?usp=share_link">Application Tracker (complex)</a> &raquo; I used this for my own internal purposes to track information and statuses of Ph.D. applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1968NuydKmU1WZXhv7Vw1gnEj9ib9ECtcdi_hTRifwcE/edit?usp=sharing">Application Tracker (simple)</a> &raquo; I used this for my own internal purposes to track information and statuses of REU/internship applications.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JlrfkySM1JpoVH-_Yw46ib9uoQfoN3thFPkg53_A8I0/edit?usp=share_link">Recommendation Request Tracker</a> &raquo; I sent copies of this to each of my recommendation writers so that we could track submissions together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the templates has helpful comments to indicate how certain fields/formatting works. Best of luck in your applications!</p>

            <p>I applied (successfully!) to the NSF GRFP during the 2024 application cycle. If you&rsquo;re intimidated or overwhelmed by the propsect of proposing like I was, here&rsquo;s some resources and advice that may help.</p>
<p>I found that referring to previous application materials (like those on <a href="https://astrobarker.github.io">Brandon Barker&rsquo;s website</a>; see the resources section) was very helpful when getting started, so feel free to do the same with mine!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/images/GRFP_ResearchStatement_LWhite.pdf">Research Statement</a></li>
<li><a href="/images/GRFP_PersonalStatement_LWhite.pdf">Personal Statement</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="some-general-advice">some general advice.</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Read the solicitation (and then read it again).</strong> Little things like formatting or timezones/deadlines can trip you up and disqualify your application before it’s even submitted and reviewed.</li>
<li><strong>Use the provided MS Word templates.</strong> They already have the correct formatting built in and can save you from mistakes or conversion errors that can happen if you use Google Docs, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Have others read your applications.</strong> I asked my current research advisor at the time, another professor in my field, and a professor who’s research wasn’t related at all (he had the most useful feedback!). Use the people in your field to make sure your science is good; find someone totally outside of your field to make sure you’re communicating well and getting the big picture across.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t panic if you&rsquo;re not starting early.</strong> I almost didn&rsquo;t apply because I nearly talked myself out of it, and then decided last minute to go through with the proposal for the experience. Make a plan, gather your thoughts, and talk to your support system, whether that&rsquo;s your advisor/PI, a favorite professor, or your family and peers. You&rsquo;ve got this!</li>
<li><strong>Think of this as a learning process!</strong> Because I submitted fellowship proposals before graduate applications opened, I was able to write my later application materials (like statements of purpose and personal statements) fairly quickly (during finals season!) because I’d essentially drafted them through my fellowship applications.</li>
</ol></blockquote>
<p><strong>DISCLAIMER.</strong> All advice above is based on my own personal experiences. Please make sure you refer to <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program">NSF.gov</a> yourself to make sure you&rsquo;re working with the most up-to-date information, solicitation, and guidelines.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          
            <p>I used <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/reu/search"><strong>this directory from NSF</strong></a> to make my initial list of REUs I wanted to apply to. Keep in mind that many of these usually link to the university websites and don&rsquo;t always show deadline info, etc. so you&rsquo;ll have to dig a little deeper to get more details. Some programs have a unified application now, so keep an eye out for that too!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Helpful tip</strong>: if there are projects or professors who you&rsquo;re interested in working with that you notice while deciding to apply, consider mentioning that (or specific aspects of the program you like) in your application! It shows that you&rsquo;ve done your research and aren&rsquo;t just randomly applying.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding personal statements, you can find two of my past (successful) personal statements linked below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ss0KnoFrItaDwTtHyf6QtIcEbrKjvug88OIp5zcjN4U/edit?usp=sharing">Sample REU Personal Statements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be scared to brag or show off unique experiences/skills you have in your personal statement. This is the place to talk about what makes you stand out and what you want to gain from the program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Helpful tip:</strong> absolutely have someone (or several people) read your personal statement! It&rsquo;s helpful for catching any mistakes and making sure you&rsquo;re communicating the message you want to get across clearly.</p></blockquote>
<p>When trying to keep track of applications, I was a big fan of putting together a spreadsheet that had all the info I (and my recommenders) might need. Feel free to make a copy of the <a href="/resources/templates/">templates</a> I created; you can find a simple version or the more complex/dynamic version I used for my grad school applications. I recommend sending your letter writers a brief spreadsheet or table of deadlines and programs as well to make their lives just a bit easier.</p>
<p>Finally, I recommend (with a word of caution) the Reddit, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/REU/">r/REU</a>. While there are some individuals on there who are just around to brag, I found this very helpful when I was just starting out to search for programs of interest, see other students&rsquo; personal statements, and learn more about the world of REUs. That being said, it also jumpstarted my impostor syndrome as well, especially as a first time applicant, so take care of your mental health and don&rsquo;t get sucked into the negativity or competitiveness.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m not the only person who&rsquo;s compiled advice, tools and resources, so here&rsquo;s the other places I&rsquo;d recommend checking out!</p>
<p>My collaborator <strong>Brandon Barker</strong> (LANL, by way of MSU) has most of his past application materials for both graduate and undergraduate fellowships and experiences compiled on <a href=""><strong>his personal website</strong></a>, along with a list of useful undergraduate research opportunities. I used this page a <em>lot</em> when developing my own applications for grad school.</p>
<p>Fellow NC State Physics alum <strong>Josh Ott</strong> (now at MIT!) has a <a href="https://joshott.net/physics/library/"><strong>library on his website</strong></a> with a variety of resources, including successful application materials, slides, and more!</p>
