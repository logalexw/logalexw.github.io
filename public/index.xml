      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello there! If you&amp;rsquo;re on this page, hopefully you&amp;rsquo;re looking for resources to help you apply for internships, REUs (research experiences for undergraduates), or graduate programs. If so, you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a non-traditional, first-gen Ph.D. student, I struggled to find information, resources, and tools when applying to a variety of academic experiences and opportunities (from REUs to grad schools!). My hope is that by sharing my own tools and resources I developed through trial and error, I can make your own journey just a little bit smoother.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts of application season (aside from writing the actual application materials) is keeping yourself and your recommenders organized! Below I&amp;rsquo;ve linked my own templates that I used for various application cycles; make a copy of these to your own Google Drive and feel free to make whatever modifications or changes suit your style!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KU_31s21nKIAj-0yuHBJBTAiIHwBGlhFNjBySU3Pxq0/edit?usp=share_link&#34;&gt;Application Tracker (complex)&lt;/a&gt; &amp;raquo; I used this for my own internal purposes to track information and statuses of Ph.D. applications.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the templates has helpful comments to indicate how certain fields/formatting works. Best of luck in your applications!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ESTER (Evolution STEllaire en Rotation; Rieutord et al. 2016) is the first open-source, multi-dimensional stellar structure code. I am working with Jane Pratt and Maxime Stuck as a GEM Fellow at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to update the &amp;lsquo;microphysics&amp;rsquo; of ESTER, with a focus on rapidly rotating stars. &lt;strong&gt;I recently implemented new, high-resolution OPLIB opacity tables (Farag et al. 2024) into the existing physics module&lt;/strong&gt;, expanding the number of opacity mixtures available in ESTER, improving interpolation methods, and enabling the future use of user-provided opacity tables.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe; SNe IIp) serve as the endpoints of the long lives of massive stars and the formative moments of young compact objects, such as black holes and neutron stars. In the data driven world of multimessenger astronomy, exploring how observations connect to theory-driven simulations is key to our understanding. &lt;strong&gt;I am currently developing a comprehensive statistical analysis of lightcurve models to investigate supernovae simulation accuracy&lt;/strong&gt; with Carla Fröhlich at North Carolina State University and Brandon Barker at Los Alamos National Lab.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Using the stellar evolution models presented in &lt;a href=&#34;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/821/1/38&#34;&gt;Sukhbold et al. 2016&lt;/a&gt;, I have modeled early timescale CCSNe hydrodynamics using &lt;a href=&#34;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aae7c9&#34;&gt;PUSH&lt;/a&gt;, calculated detailed nucleosynthesis for all exploding models using a 2000+ isotope nuclear reaction network, and generated post-collapse bolometric lightcurves using the SuperNova Explosion Code (SNEC). I am now exploring the connection between our simulations and observed lightcurves using the methodologies first used in &lt;a href=&#34;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac77f3&#34;&gt;Barker et al. 2022&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/acb052&#34;&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay tuned for two upcoming publications detailing this work!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I applied (successfully!) to the NSF GRFP during the 2024 application cycle. If you&amp;rsquo;re intimidated or overwhelmed by the propsect of proposing like I was, here&amp;rsquo;s some resources and advice that may help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that referring to previous application materials (like those on &lt;a href=&#34;https://astrobarker.github.io&#34;&gt;Brandon Barker&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;; see the resources section) was very helpful when getting started, so feel free to do the same with mine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://logalexw.github.io/images/GRFP_ResearchStatement_LWhite.pdf&#34;&gt;Research Statement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;some-general-advice&#34;&gt;some general advice.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the solicitation (and then read it again).&lt;/strong&gt; Little things like formatting or timezones/deadlines can trip you up and disqualify your application before it’s even submitted and reviewed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the provided MS Word templates.&lt;/strong&gt; They already have the correct formatting built in and can save you from mistakes or conversion errors that can happen if you use Google Docs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have others read your applications.&lt;/strong&gt; I asked my current research advisor at the time, another professor in my field, and a professor who’s research wasn’t related at all (he had the most useful feedback!). Use the people in your field to make sure your science is good; find someone totally outside of your field to make sure you’re communicating well and getting the big picture across.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t panic if you&amp;rsquo;re not starting early.&lt;/strong&gt; I almost didn&amp;rsquo;t apply because I nearly talked myself out of it, and then decided last minute to go through with the proposal for the experience. Make a plan, gather your thoughts, and talk to your support system, whether that&amp;rsquo;s your advisor/PI, a favorite professor, or your family and peers. You&amp;rsquo;ve got this!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think of this as a learning process!&lt;/strong&gt; Because I submitted fellowship proposals before graduate applications opened, I was able to write my later application materials (like statements of purpose and personal statements) fairly quickly (during finals season!) because I’d essentially drafted them through my fellowship applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER.&lt;/strong&gt; All advice above is based on my own personal experiences. Please make sure you refer to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program&#34;&gt;NSF.gov&lt;/a&gt; yourself to make sure you&amp;rsquo;re working with the most up-to-date information, solicitation, and guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dark matter halos and their surrounding subhalo populations mirror the structure and evolution of galactic systems like our Milky Way and its nearby dwarf galaxies. Modeling how these structures change for different models of dark matter can better inform our understanding of cosmological theory. &lt;strong&gt;I investigated long-scale dark matter structure evolution using &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03635&#34;&gt;COZMIC&lt;/a&gt;, an N-body cosmological simulation suite&lt;/strong&gt;, with Ethan Nadler and Vera Gluscevic through the Simons-NSBP Scholars Program at the Flatiron institute. I examined halo and subhalo mass distribution around Milky Way-like galaxies over long timescales, and produced first measurements of the time-dependence of the subhalo mass function for beyond-CDM models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>REUs &#43; internships.</title>
      <link>https://logalexw.github.io/resources/reu/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://logalexw.github.io/resources/reu/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/reu/search&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this directory from NSF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make my initial list of REUs I wanted to apply to. Keep in mind that many of these usually link to the university websites and don&amp;rsquo;t always show deadline info, etc. so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to dig a little deeper to get more details. Some programs have a unified application now, so keep an eye out for that too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helpful tip&lt;/strong&gt;: if there are projects or professors who you&amp;rsquo;re interested in working with that you notice while deciding to apply, consider mentioning that (or specific aspects of the program you like) in your application! It shows that you&amp;rsquo;ve done your research and aren&amp;rsquo;t just randomly applying.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It shows that you&amp;rsquo;ve done your research and aren&amp;rsquo;t just randomly applying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding personal statements, you can find two of my past (successful) personal statements linked below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ss0KnoFrItaDwTtHyf6QtIcEbrKjvug88OIp5zcjN4U/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;Sample REU Personal Statements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t be scared to brag or show off unique experiences/skills you have in your personal statement. This is the place to talk about what makes you stand out and what you want to gain from the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helpful tip:&lt;/strong&gt; absolutely have someone (or several people) read your personal statement! It&amp;rsquo;s helpful for catching any mistakes and making sure you&amp;rsquo;re communicating the message you want to get across clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying to keep track of applications, I was a big fan of putting together a spreadsheet that had all the info I (and my recommenders) might need. Feel free to make a copy of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://logalexw.github.io/resources/templates/&#34;&gt;templates&lt;/a&gt; I created; you can find a simple version or the more complex/dynamic version I used for my grad school applications. I recommend sending your letter writers a brief spreadsheet or table of deadlines and programs as well to make their lives just a bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I recommend (with a word of caution) the Reddit, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/REU/&#34;&gt;r/REU&lt;/a&gt;. While there are some individuals on there who are just around to brag, I found this very helpful when I was just starting out to search for programs of interest, see other students&amp;rsquo; personal statements, and learn more about the world of REUs. That being said, it also jumpstarted my impostor syndrome as well, especially as a first time applicant, so take care of your mental health and don&amp;rsquo;t get sucked into the negativity or competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Predictive models for solar weather and activity rely on large amounts of data from extensive timescales, from one year to multiple 11-year-long solar cycles. I worked with Slava Sadykov at Georgia State University to support the development of more accurate prediction models for solar activity. &lt;strong&gt;Using magnetograms from the operational overlap between the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO/MDI), I established machine learning models to enable the creation of a homogenous magnetic dataset spanning from 1994-present.&lt;/strong&gt; These regression models resolved differences in instrument resolution, operational limitations, and observatory location. I also researched algorithm refinement and effectiveness on active regions and the quiet Sun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Fellow NC State Physics alum &lt;strong&gt;Josh Ott&lt;/strong&gt; (now at MIT!) has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://joshott.net/physics/library/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;library on his website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a variety of resources, including successful application materials, slides, and more!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science provides an understanding of a universal experience, and arts provides a universal understanding of a personal experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;about me.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;strong&gt;first-year Ph.D. student in Astronomy &amp;amp; Astrophysics&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;NSF Graduate Research Fellow&lt;/strong&gt; at the University of Arizona, where I work with Carl Fields to model the &lt;strong&gt;life, evolution, and death of massive stars&lt;/strong&gt; using a variety of astrophysics codes, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/&#34;&gt;MESA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lanl/phoebus&#34;&gt;PHOEBUS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I currently research the &lt;a href=&#34;https://logalexw.github.io/research/ester/&#34;&gt;structure of stellar interiors&lt;/a&gt; with Jane Pratt as a GEM Fellow at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, and am working on extending the physics of the 2D open-source code ESTER. I also research the &lt;a href=&#34;https://logalexw.github.io/research/ccsne/&#34;&gt;hydrodynamics, nucleosynthesis, and observables of core-collapse supernovae in 1D&lt;/a&gt; with Carla Fröhlich at my undergraduate alma mater, North Carolina State University. Generally, I enjoy using computational methods to explore the border between theory, experiment, and observation!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m not writing code, you can find me working on a variety of science communication, mentorship, and outreach projects. I currently serve on the Student Council for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nsbp.org&#34;&gt;National Society of Black Physicists&lt;/a&gt; and am the &lt;strong&gt;Student Editorial Lead of Waves &amp;amp; Packets&lt;/strong&gt;, NSBP&amp;rsquo;s newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want more info on my background, please see my &lt;a href=&#34;https://logalexw.github.io/images/cv.pdf&#34;&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt;. You can also find useful &lt;a href=&#34;https://logalexw.github.io/resources/&#34;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; for undergraduates and non-traditional students!&lt;/p&gt;
